<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Shivprasad Mahind, and I am currently persuing BTech degree in Computer Engineering at Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering (PCCOE) Akurdi.
  I have just completed my first year of engineering, which has been an exciting and enriching experiencing so far. </p>
<p>As I embark on my summer break, which spans the months of June and July, I find myself with two months of free time. 
 So, I decided to utilize this time by enrolling in a Web Development course.</p>
